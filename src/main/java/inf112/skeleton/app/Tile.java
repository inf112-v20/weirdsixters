/**
 * Tile is a representation of a board tile.
 * It contains all the attributes a tile can have.
 *
 * The goal is to base actions on tile-attributes instead of tile-kinds, and
 * maybe remove TileKind completely. This may be achieved by making the
 * Tile-class contain all unique attributes of all kinds of tiles, and
 * "ask questions" based on those attributes.
 * Ex.:
 * - Is this tile blocking this direction?
 * - How much will this tile rotate me?
 * - How fast (if at all) will this tile push me forward?
 *
 * Right-angled walls have two directions. These are stored in
 * direction and secondDirection. `direction` is the clockwise one, while
 * `secondDirection` is the counter-clockwise one.
